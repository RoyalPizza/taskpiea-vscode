[TASKS]
- update styling for better syntax highlighting [#CF390]
    -- keep the standard theming support, but add more variety
- do a performance test on project with large codebases [#3F6A4]
    -- record some metrics so I have an idea if I need to switch to grep or something
- do a stress test of the exclude system for the scanner  [#85FD9]
    -- basically make sure that it works when loosley formatted
- make a real icon for the extension and .taskp files [#DE5EB]
    -- keep the clouds and golden icon reference as a homage to skypiea
- update categories in project.json [#1BB10]
    -- something other than 'other' ideally
- make a better readme [#61AE2]
- move to its own repo and update package.json [#6428A]
- looked into "verified publishing" to avoid the popup on the extension when installing. [#F1C91]
- do a revamp of include & exclude [#A8413]
    -- .git and other well known names should never be searched
    -- this is only meant for code, so perhaps I should default to have includes only for code files
    -- if I do an include system, I need to decide if it should be hardcoded, or configurable.
    -- I do not really like the configuration idea because it adds alot of settings. And I can see
    -- no reason to allow the flexibility to search keywords in non code files. 
    -- this should help speed up the search through files drastically.
    -- UPDATE: I hard coded this as a quick solution. But need to think on this.
- is this working?
